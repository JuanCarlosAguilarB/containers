# Jenkins Setup using Docker

This repository contains configurations and instructions for setting up Jenkins using Docker.

## Getting Started

To get Jenkins up and running locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Docker Compose Configuration

Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to include Jenkins service. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  jenkins:
    image: jenkins/jenkins:lts
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"   # Jenkins web interface
      - "50000:50000" # Jenkins agent communication
    environment:
      - JAVA_OPTS=-Djenkins.install.runSetupWizard=false
    volumes:
      - ./jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home
    networks:
      - jenkins

```

Adjust the configuration based on your specific requirements. This example sets up Jenkins with a web interface on port `8080` and agent communication on port `50000`. It also sets up a volume for Jenkins data persistence.

### 2. Environment Variables

- **JAVA_OPTS**: You can use this to set JVM options for Jenkins. In this example, `-Djenkins.install.runSetupWizard=false` skips the initial setup wizard.

### 3. Start Jenkins

Run Docker Compose to start Jenkins:

```bash
docker-compose up -d jenkins
```

This command starts Jenkins in detached mode (`-d`).

### 4. Access Jenkins Web Interface

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the Jenkins web interface. Follow the setup instructions to complete the initial configuration.

### 5. Using Jenkins

You can now use Jenkins in your Docker environment. Configure Jenkins as needed through the web interface. Set up jobs, pipelines, and integrate with other tools.

### 6. Additional Configurations

- **Plugins**: You can install plugins via the Jenkins web interface to extend functionality.
- **Security**: Configure Jenkins security settings according to your requirements. You can set up user authentication and permissions.
- **Backup**: Ensure that you back up the data stored in `./jenkins_home` (or your specified volume) regularly to prevent data loss.

### 7. Clean Up

To stop and remove the Jenkins container:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This command removes the Jenkins container and its associated volumes.

---

## Also, you can run Jenkins quickly with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name jenkins \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 50000:50000 \
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

This command starts Jenkins with similar configuration, using a Docker volume for data persistence.
